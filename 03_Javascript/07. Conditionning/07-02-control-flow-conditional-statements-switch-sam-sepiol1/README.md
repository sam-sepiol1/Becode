# JavaScript Control Flow - Switch Assignment

In this assignment, you will be working with the `switch` statement in JavaScript. The goal is to reinforce your understanding of how to use `switch` for more structured conditional statements.

## Instructions

1. Open the `switchStatements.js` file.
2. Implement the functions as per the instructions provided in each function's comment block.
3. Save the file and run the tests using Jest to verify your implementations.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open `switchStatements.js`.
3. Follow the instructions within each function's comments.
4. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
5. Run `npm test` to test your code using Jest.

## Functions to Implement

| Function Name                | Description                                                       |
|------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `getDayName(dayNumber)`       | Implement a function to return the day name based on the day number (1-7). |
| `calculateDiscount(itemType)` | Implement a function to calculate a discount based on the item type.(electronics -> 20%, clothing -> 15%) |
| `getSeason(month)`            | Implement a function to return the season based on the month (1-12). |
| `convertGrade(grade)`         | Implement a function to convert a numeric grade into a letter grade. (above 90 = A, above 75 = B, under 75 = F)|
| `getShippingCost(weight, type)` | Implement a function to calculate shipping cost based on weight and type. (1€ per weight unit + 5€ for 'standard', 15€ for express, 20€ for overnight) |
| `calculateTax(amount, state)`   | Implement a function to calculate tax based on the amount and state.      |
| `getTrafficSignalColor(code)`   | Implement a function to get the traffic signal color based on the code.   |

## Files Included

- `switchStatements.js`: Starter file where you will write your code.
- `switchStatements.test.js`: Test file to check your implementations using Jest.
