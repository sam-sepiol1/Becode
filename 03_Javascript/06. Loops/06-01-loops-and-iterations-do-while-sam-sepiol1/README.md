# JavaScript Loops and Iterations - Do...While Statement Assignment

This assignment aims to reinforce the understanding and usage of the 'do...while' statement in JavaScript.

## Instructions

1. Open the `doWhileStatement.js` file.
2. Complete the functions as per the instructions provided in each function's comment block.
3. Save the file and run the tests using Jest to verify your implementations.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open `doWhileStatement.js`.
3. Follow the instructions within each function's comments.
4. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
5. Run `npm test` to test your code using Jest.
