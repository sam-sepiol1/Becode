# JavaScript Data Types Introduction - Number Assignment

This assignment focuses on understanding and manipulating the `number` data type in JavaScript.

## Instructions

1. Open the `numberOperations.js` file.
2. Complete the functions as per the instructions provided in each function's comment block.
3. Save the file and run the tests using Jest to verify your implementations.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open `numberOperations.js`.
3. Follow the instructions within each function's comments.
4. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
5. Run `npm test` to test your code using Jest.

## Functions to Implement

| Function Name          | Description                                                                         |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `addNumbers()`         | Return the sum of two numbers provided as arguments.                                  |
| `subtractNumbers()`    | Return the difference between two numbers provided as arguments.                      |
| `multiplyNumbers()`    | Return the product of two numbers provided as arguments.                               |
| `divideNumbers()`      | Return the result of dividing the first number by the second number (non-zero).       |
| `powerOfNumber()`      | Return the result of raising the first number to the power of the second number.      |

## Files Included

- `numberOperations.js`: Starter file where you will write your code.
- `numberOperations.test.js`: Test file to check your implementations using Jest.
