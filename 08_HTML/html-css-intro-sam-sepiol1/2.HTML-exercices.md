## Exercices :

- Translate [this txt document](./doc-the-chinese-farmer.txt) into semantic html, using the right html tags : `h1`, `h2`, `section`, `blockquote`, `q`, `img`, `p`, `figure` and `caption`, `table`, `th`, `tr`, `td`, `ul` or `ol` and `li`.
- No `div` or `span`: they do not provide any semantics.
- Find, for each of these tags, the origin of their name (that's how we remember them). If in doubt, look for the answer on [html5doctor.com](http://html5doctor.com).
- Add two or three links of your choice in the html page via the tag `a`
- Is there a part that could be considered as a header? If so, group it in a `header` tag.
- And a footer? If so, group this content together in a `footer` tag
- Put all instances of the words "Maybe" in a `em` or `strong` tag.

There is a snowman entity code. Find it! (you will need to google it)

Use the registered trademark entity code (the circled R at the end) , AND be sure to make it superscript

Note: No one expects you to memorize any of the entity codes. Get used to googling them! It's normal!
