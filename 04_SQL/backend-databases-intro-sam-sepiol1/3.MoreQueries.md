# Intro to relational databases and schemas

## Practical Information

-   Repository: `no repository`
-   Deadline: 1 day

## Learning Objectives

-   Model a simple relational DB model
-   Perform CRUD operations on a Database

## Exercise

Today, you will use SQL queries to another extent.
Provided with this README, is a file called [database](./database), you will train to create sql queries using that file!

To help you, here is the db schema of said table.

![dbtable](./assets/dbschema.png)

You will use sqlite that you installed yesterday.

You will learn a lot of new things so keep calm and tackle one challenge at the time!

You can do it!

## Challenges

To start, use your terminal to navigate into the folder where you cloned the file database, and run :

```
sqlite3 database
```

### SELECT

1. Write a query to display the names (first_name, last_name) of all the employees. ✅
   SELECT first_name, last_name FROM employees;

2. Write a query to get all employee details and order them by first name, descending. ✅
   SELECT \* FROM employees order by first_name ASC;

3. Write a query to get the total salaries payable to employees. ✅
   SELECT sum(salary) as total_salary FROM employees;

4. Write a query to get the maximum and minimum salary from employees table. ✅
   SELECT max(salary) as max_salary, min(salary) as min_salary FROM employees;

5. Write a query to get monthly salary (round 2 decimal places) of each and every employee. To get the monthly salary of an employee, divide the annual salary by `12,2` ✅
   SELECT first_name, last_name, ROUND(salary / 12, 2) AS monthly_salary FROM employees ORDER BY last_name ASC ;

### Restricting and Sorting Data

6. Write a query to display the names (first_name, last_name) and salary for all employees whose salary is not in the range $10,000 through $15,000 ✅
   SELECT first_name, last_name, salary from employees where ( salary < 10000 or salary > 15000 );

7. Write a query to display the names (first_name, last_name) and salary for all employees whose salary is not in the range $10,000 through $15,000 and are in department 30 or 100. ✅
   SELECT first_name, last_name, salary from employees where ( salary < 10000 or salary > 15000 )and (department_id = 30 or department_id = 100);

8. Write a query to display the last names of employees having 'e' as the third character. ✅
   SELECT first_name, last_name FROM employees WHERE last_name LIKE '\_\_e%';

### Aggregate Functions and Group by

9. Write a query to list the number of jobs available in the employees table. ✅
   SELECT COUNT( DISTINCT job_id) as number_of_jobs FROM employees;

10. Write a query to get the department ID and the total salary payable in each department. ✅
    SELECT department_id, SUM(salary) AS total_salary FROM employees GROUP BY department_id;

11. Write a query to get the average salary for all departments employing more than 10 employees. ✅
    SELECT department_id FROM employees GROUP BY department_id HAVING COUNT(\*) > 10;

### Subquery

13. Write a query to find the names (first_name, last_name) and salaries of the employees who have a higher salary than the employee whose last_name='Bull'. ✅

        SELECT first_name, last_name, salary FROM employees WHERE salary > (SELECT salary FROM employees WHERE last_name = 'Bull');

14. Write a query to find the names (first_name, last_name) of the employees who have a manager who works for a department based in the United States. ✅

SELECT e.first_name, e.last_name
FROM employees e
JOIN employees m ON e.manager_id = m.employee_id -- Join to get the manager details
JOIN departments d ON m.department_id = d.department_id -- Join to get manager's department
JOIN locations l ON d.location_id = l.location_id -- Join to get the department's location
JOIN countries c ON l.country_id = c.country_id -- Join to get the country details
WHERE c.country_name = 'United States of America';

Hint : Write single-row and multiple-row subqueries

### JOINS

15. Write a query to find the names (first_name, last name), department ID and the name of all the employees. ✅
    SELECT e.first_name, e.last_name, e.department_id, d.depart_name
    FROM employees e
    JOIN departments d ON d.department_id = e.department_id;

16. Write a query to to display job title, employee name, and the difference between the salary of the employee and minimum salary for the job. ✅
    SELECT e.first_name, e.last_name, j.job_title, (e.salary - j.min_salary) AS salary_difference
    FROM employees e
    JOIN jobs j ON e.job_id = j.job_id;

Good luck everybody!
