# Intro to relational databases and schemas

## Learning Objectives

- Model a simple relational DB model

## Exercise

Today, I will ask you to create the database schema of this [platform](https://stackoverflow.com/). To start of, try writing on a piece of paper all the instances you can analyse on the webapp, how do you think they are built.
Once you feel like you are ready. Go on this [online tool](https://ondras.zarovi.cz/sql/demo/) and start building the most amazing db schema.

This challenge is not about perfection, as there is no way you can guess what actually is their database schema. But more about discovering and do the mental work of creating something that works.

While you are designing this schema. Do not forget about the different kind of relationships you can have on a schema. Because they will change the way you construct it.

To finnish. If you want to design something else than the webApp I provided, go ahead, be crazy.

A last word of topic. Designing the db before writing any code is exactly what Developers do in a professional environement. This challenge is not just any challenge, it is about learning a big part of a project timeline.

# Extra challenge

To Visualize Data, And quickly test everything, I would ask you to install [sqlite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html). It is a simple database that stores everything in one file. Very cool to test out and learn and have a first experience. Not very cool for bigger scope projects.

on macOS

```
brew install sqlite
```

on Ubuntu

```
sudo apt-get install sqlite3 libsqlite3-dev
```

The bonus challenge is for you to test out your db on the sqlite environment. And to try and do queries on it

To start up, go into a new folder via your terminal and type

```
sqlite3 db.sqlite
```

it should create a file called db.sqlite

from there i'll let you look at [you knew it: the doc!](https://sqlite.org/cli.html)

Good luck everybody!
