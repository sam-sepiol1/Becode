# Using SQL

## Learning Objectives

- Model a simple relational DB model

## Exercise

Lets learn some sql queries!

#### Steps

To start up, go into a new folder via your terminal and type

```
sqlite3 db.sqlite
```

it should create a file called `db.sqlite`

Okay, you are all set up to write your first queries in sqlite.

Lets first do some nice setup on our database.

Lets create a new table

```sql
CREATE TABLE `johnson` (
  `id`  INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
  `name` TEXT,
  `age` INTEGER,
  `specialty` TEXT
);
```

This will create a new table in our database. (Very cool!)

want to know what kind of data you can store?
well check out [this beautiful page](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_datatypes.asp)

Okay, next step will be to add some data in there.

lets run

```sql
INSERT INTO johnson (name, age, specialty) VALUES ('Snoop Diog', 1000, "I know some javascript");
```

and

```sql
INSERT INTO johnson (name, age, specialty) VALUES ('Nico the wise', 23, "Stock market, rumba and security");
```

Nice!

lets now check that we really have entries in our database!

by running

```
.mode column
```

then

```
.headers on
```

and finally

```sql
SELECT * FROM johnson;
```

Cool if your terminal shows you the right data, that means it worked!

Lets recap. We already learned three things! How to create a **table** using SQL, how to insert a **row**
using SQL and how to retrieve every **row** from a **table** using SQL!

Pretty neat!

lets go deeper!

Lets say, that i really want to select only the second hopper on my table...

Well I can do that!

```sql
SELECT * FROM johnson WHERE id = 2;
```

pretty cool no?

Yes, pretty cool!

lets go deeper!

Okay, i did lie... I'm not really 1000 years old...

Lets put the truth back there and update my age.

```sql
UPDATE johnson SET age = 40 WHERE id = 1;

```

okay lets see if it worked

```sql
SELECT * FROM johnson WHERE id = 1;
```

did it worked?

NICE!

Lets continue!

Lets say that I don't want to see my ugly face on that database anymore...

Well yeah, i want to get rid of it!

Well its easy enough!

```sql
DELETE FROM johnson WHERE id = 1;
```

Okay, lets do a run down of what we've learned so far

we learned to:

`__C__ reate a new row in the database`
`__R__ ead the content of one specific row from the db`
`__U__ pdate the content of a specific row from the db`
`__D__ elete a row from the db`

Well that looks pretty intense no, and was not that complicated no?

Take a break, and then come back to it and try to read some doc about what else you can do using SQL queries.

Good luck everybody!
