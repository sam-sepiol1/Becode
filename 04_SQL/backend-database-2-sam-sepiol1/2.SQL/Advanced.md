Go GO GO!

## 🌱 Must-haves

### The syntax: learning SQL

This [basic MySQL tutorial](https://www.mysqltutorial.org/basic-mysql-tutorial.aspx) explains some basic SQL statements. If this is the first time you have used a relational database management system, this tutorial teaches you everything you need to know to work with MySQL such as querying data, updating data, managing databases, and creating tables.

This is a selection of all interesting and common used ways of reading data out MySQL.
With the knowledge you will gain here, you will be able to answer all questions below!

    - [LIMIT – use LIMIT to constrain the number of rows returned by SELECT statement](https://www.mysqltutorial.org/mysql-limit.aspx)
    - [IS NULL – test whether a value is NULL or not by using IS NULL operator.](https://www.mysqltutorial.org/mysql-is-null/)
    - [Subquery – show you how to nest a query (inner query) within another query (outer query) and use the result of the inner query for the outer query.](https://www.mysqltutorial.org/mysql-subquery/)

1. Joining tables
    - [Table & Column Aliases – introduce you to table and column aliases.](https://www.mysqltutorial.org/mysql-alias/)
    - [LEFT JOIN – return all rows from the left table and matching rows from the right table or null if no matching rows found in the right table.](https://www.mysqltutorial.org/mysql-left-join.aspx)

### Import the database

Every database can always be exported (or imported) as a sql file.
Download [the sample database](mysqlsampledatabase.zip) and import it through your database manager in a newly created database. Make yourself familiar with the structure.

![schema](../_assets/db.png)

> **MSRP**
> Because our sample database is American it uses the abbreviation MSRP, short for *manufacturer's suggested retail price*.
The manufacturer's suggested retail price (MSRP) is the price that a product's manufacturer recommends it is sold for at point of sale. The MSRP is also referred to as the list price by some retailers.
