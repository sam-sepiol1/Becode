# 5.2: Add some features

## Today's Learning Objectives

Complete the application. 

## Your Mission

### Step 1. Delete Button

Add a Delete button attached to each todo. This button should be only activated if the checkbox is checked. 

You'll need to remove the todo from the todos' state. 

### Step 2. Counter

At the bottom of your app, add a counter to display to the user how many todos he still needs to complete -> `3 todos left`. 

Base your counter on the todos checked.

### Step 3. Delete all todos completed

Have a delete button for each todo is nice, but have a button do delete all the todos completed should be better.

Add this feature please. 

### Step 4. Add categories to divide private & work life


## Good Luck!
